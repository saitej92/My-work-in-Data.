The use case is for a real time taxi data in a city and they want to maximize the no of responses to the requests the users make with less number
of taxis in a single geo hash.
The problem is to know the supply demand of the taxis in a geohash and also how it surges or otherwise in the same location.
Also other problems include some suspicious rides and then people with no payments and getting discounts on the first rides along with different 
payment types for all the rides in each location.
